# signald 0.12.0

[see all code changes here](https://gitlab.com/signald/signald/-/compare/0.11.1...0.12.0)

This release brings some changes to the git repo, a wider range of group v2 features, as well and ARM and Intel Mac support.

Thanks to these contributors:
* [GitHub PR #12](https://github.com/thefinn93/signald/pull/12) - **ftyers** added an important line that was missing from the Debian documentation.
* [!42](https://gitlab.com/signald/signald/-/merge_requests/42) and [!43](https://gitlab.com/signald/signald/-/merge_requests/43) - **3ob** fixed a number of issues with the README.  


### Git repo changes

As promised in the 0.11.0 release notes, the git repo has moved to [gitlab.com/signald/signald](https://gitlab.com/signald/signald)
and the default branch has changed to `main`. 

### Debian repo changes

Please update your `sources.list`:

```
deb https://updates.signald.org unstable main
```

deb publishing has been make much simpler by switching from home-grown debian repo management tooling to [aptly](https://www.aptly.info/). The new
process runs on GitLab.com CI. The old CI server is still operating, and the old repo will continue to work for the time
being, but is deprecated and users should switch over to the new one.

### Mac/ARM support
It is now possible to build signald for alternative build targets, such as Mac and ARM. The native libraries are
cross-compiled for a number of targets, and signald's build.gradle attempts to detect the correct one. Detection can be
overridden by setting the `SIGNALD_TARGET` environment variable when running gradle. Library cross-compilation happens
in the [libraries repo](https://gitlab.com/signald/libraries).

aarch64 docker images are available at `finn/signald:aarch64-latest` and `registry.gitlab.com/signald/signald:aarch64-latest`.

The debian repo is still amd64 only, unfortunately.
