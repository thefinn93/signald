## New Features
* Read receipts can now be sent. Thanks to [@ekpneo](https://gitlab.com/ekpneo), who contributed this
in [!10](https://gitlab.com/thefinn93/signald/-/merge_requests/10).
* Support for [setting a users profile name and reading profile names of others](https://gitlab.com/thefinn93/signald/-/merge_requests/6)
has been added.
* Support for [registration captchas](https://gitlab.com/thefinn93/signald/-/commit/d1591adf59ce5fa77f39d3850066c1e374ad2e06) has been added,
although feedback on it has thus far been minimal. If you are unable to register without a captcha, please try to register
with a captcha ([instructions here](https://gitlab.com/thefinn93/signald/issues/8#note_230856982)) and respond to [#8](https://gitlab.com/thefinn93/signald/issues/8)
letting us know how it went. 
* [Stickers can now be received](https://gitlab.com/thefinn93/signald/-/blob/84374330a5a020196ac64670ba546bdb16206b0d/src/main/java/io/finn/signald/JsonSticker.java).
* Support for receiving the [full range of sync messages](https://gitlab.com/thefinn93/signald/-/commit/2b9a92d39cef17aac27007b2d689856467709fc4)
 (sent from other devices on the account) available in this version of libsignal:
  * [StickerPackOperations can now be received](https://gitlab.com/thefinn93/signald/-/blob/84374330a5a020196ac64670ba546bdb16206b0d/src/main/java/io/finn/signald/JsonStickerPackOperationMessage.java).
  These are commands from other linked devices on the same account to do things like add or remove sticker packs.
  * [SentTranscriptMessages](https://gitlab.com/thefinn93/signald/-/blob/84374330a5a020196ac64670ba546bdb16206b0d/src/main/java/io/finn/signald/JsonSentTranscriptMessage.java)
  can now be received. This appears to be how Signal clients indicate to other devices that they have sent a message now.
  * [View once views](https://gitlab.com/thefinn93/signald/-/blob/84374330a5a020196ac64670ba546bdb16206b0d/src/main/java/io/finn/signald/JsonViewOnceOpenMessage.java)
  can now be received, indicating that the user has viewed view-once media on a different client.
  * [Verification sync messages](https://gitlab.com/thefinn93/signald/-/blob/84374330a5a020196ac64670ba546bdb16206b0d/src/main/java/io/finn/signald/JsonVerifiedMessage.java)
  can now be received, indicating that the user has changed the verification status of another user's key.


## Improvements
* A spelling mistake in the systemd unit file was fixed. Thanks to [@Strykar](https://gitlab.com/Strykar), who contributed this change in
[!7](https://gitlab.com/thefinn93/signald/-/merge_requests/7).
* The username of the account receiving the message is now included in untrusted identity errors.
Thanks to [@aguestuser](https://gitlab.com/aguestuser), who contributed this change in [!8](https://gitlab.com/thefinn93/signald/-/merge_requests/8).
* Assorted code cleanup caused by use of an actual Java IDE, including updated copyright year on all Java files.
* If the socket file exists when signald is started, it will attempt to delete it so it can create it's own.
This is a workaround to a common annoyance.
* Attempting to `subscribe` to nonexistent accounts will now throw an error (see [#16](https://gitlab.com/thefinn93/signald/issues/16)).
Thanks to [@hoehermann](https://gitlab.com/hoehermann) for filing that issue.
* Fixed a bug ([#20](https://gitlab.com/thefinn93/signald/issues/20)) where messages were received after the client unsubscribed.
* Fixed a bug in [how sealed sender messages are decrypted](https://gitlab.com/thefinn93/signald/-/commit/d2bd09f33173e83362e5174b284eb5431dae71ac). Thanks to `demure` on IRC for finding this bug and helping test fixes.
* Trying to get better about release notes. Feedback on this format appreciated.
