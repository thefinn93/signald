# signald 0.15.0

[see all code changes here](https://gitlab.com/signald/signald/-/compare/0.14.1...0.15.0)

## âš  Breaking Change: New Default Socket File Location
As promised in the 0.14.0 release, the default socket file location is now `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/signald/signald.sock`.

This does not affect Docker users, users of the apt repository, or users that otherwise specify a path for the socket file.

Other users, mostly from-source installs, may experience breakage if the client hasn't updated to support this yet.
Users in this situation should explicitly specify the new socket path in the client configuration. Alternatively, users
wishing to run signald in system-wide mode, use flag `--system-socket`

Client authors, please update your clients to check the new location first and fall back to the old location, which is still
supported for system-wide installations. See [Socket Protocol](https://signald.org/articles/protocol/) page for more
details. The systemd unit file installed by the Debian package will continue to use the current socket path, which will be
considered "system" mode. Open an issue or pop into [chat](https://signald.org/articles/IRC/) if you have questions.

## Docker Changes
* The Docker Hub image is now at [`signald/signald`](https://hub.docker.com/r/signald/signald). Previous one will be updated for the time being,
    but will be removed eventually.
* The Docker image now support multiple CPU architectures, including armv7 and arm64.

See the [Docker](https://signald.org/articles/install/docker/) page for details.

## libsignal update
[libsignal has been updated](https://gitlab.com/signald/signald/-/merge_requests/77), which created some database migrations. Users of
alternate servers will need to update those server settings. As far as I know this is not currently something people do. If it is, please
get in touch so we can talk about how to make these kind of changes less painful in the future. The production and staging Signal servers
will be automatically migrated. The new libsignal version has two new features: announcement groups, which are supported in signald,  and
sender keys [are not yet supported in signald](https://gitlab.com/signald/signald/-/issues/185).

Note that users have reported receiving [401 Authorization Failed](https://gitlab.com/signald/signald/-/issues/216) message after upgrading,
but it goes away before it can be debugged further.

## Other
* [MobileCoin Payment Support](https://gitlab.com/signald/signald/-/merge_requests/67) was added
* Prometheus-compatible metrics are now available. Enable with flag `-m` or `--metrics`, or by setting environment variable
`SIGNALD_ENABLE_METRICS=true`
  * Default port is 9595, change with `--metrics-http-port` or by setting environment variable `SIGNALD_METRICS_PORT`
  * If you want a new metric, get in touch.
* [Updating Group Descriptions](https://gitlab.com/signald/signald/-/merge_requests/72) is now supported, thanks to @inwaves
* [`get_remote_config`](https://signald.org/protocol/actions/v1/get_remote_config/) request is now available, thanks again to
    @inwaves ([!72](https://gitlab.com/signald/signald/-/merge_requests/72))
* The default server has been updated to use the new domain, `chat.signal.org`
* command line flag `--log-http-requests` or environment file `SIGNALD_HTTP_LOGGING=true` are now available for debugging purposes.
    If either of them is set, signald will log all HTTP traffic to and from the server.
* Several v1 fields still inadvertantly still reference v0 types. This is being rectified by creating identical v1 types:
    * `v1.JsonSendMessageResult`'s `success` field previously referenced a libsignal type, which was updated
    to something that breaks the JSON encoder. The field type has been changed to a signald type that should produce identical
    JSON.
    * `JsonAttachment` was not previously available in v1 and now is, identical to it's v0 counterpart
* The v1 `send` request type now has a field to attach previews of links in the message. Signal has supported this feature for a while,
    it just hasn't been a high priority. More fields were added to the [`JsonPreview`](https://signald.org/protocol/structures/v1/JsonPreview/)
    type which are also available when receiving previews.
* signald no longer responds to sync requests from other devices on the account unless it is device 1 (details in [#215](https://gitlab.com/signald/signald/-/issues/215))
* The protocol document now includes details about which error messages to expect from which request types, and sometimes
    details about what each error means. More information about this will come, but this is a first step towards having the
    error list be visible and having a specific place to translate error data into versioned, documented JSON.
* [`deny_membership`](https://signald.org/protocol/actions/v1/deny_membership/) request is now available to deny group membership applications.
* signald intends to drop Java 8 support. A WARN-level log message will be printed at startup if java 8 is detected. ([#219](https://gitlab.com/signald/signald/-/issues/219))
* signald intends to drop v1 group support. Please direct comments to [#224](https://gitlab.com/signald/signald/-/issues/224).
